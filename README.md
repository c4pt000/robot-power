 to also power a heavy bot like "Fedor"
to do construction
by taking in carbon dioxide from the air
seperating to oxygen out
to burn the oxygen to power a generator the size of a yellow pages
(power supply) in the robot's abdomen to power electricity for robot
 no solar, no recharge, no gas just air intake capture carbon
 burn oxygen as combustible source for a mini generator to power electric source for heavy bot 
 think military application and or space construction
 and or drone power
 ```
